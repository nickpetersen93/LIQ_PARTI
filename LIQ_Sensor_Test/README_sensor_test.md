Upload this script to your LIQ HD system and open the serial plotter on the Arduino IDE to visually test lick threshold settings! It is recomended to test only 2-4 sensors because the serial plotter begins to run slowly. If the serial plotter is running too quickly to visualize detected licks, you can slow it down by adding a delay (change "delay_time"). Run this test on a fully built LIQ system in its experimental environment because certain changes, such as wire length, will affect the necessary threshold settings.
